          <p className={styles.sub_title}>
            Passdown is committed to resolving any disagreement that arises out of or related to this Agreement or its breach.

              <b>Binding Arbitration Rules:</b> In case of a disagreement related to these Terms of Service or Passdown's Site, or a breach thereof, you and Passdown agree to resolve it by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Consumer Arbitration Rules. Any court with jurisdiction can enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. The AAA arbitration rules and forms are located on its website, which are incorporated herein by reference. You can also call the American Arbitration Association for additional information or answers to questions about its rules or procedures by calling 1-800-778-7879. As a result of these Terms of Service, the AAA rules may be changed expressly or impliedly. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and applicability of this Arbitration Agreement. Passdown and you further agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts is excluded and not applicable to this relation.

            <li>
              <b>Arbitration Initiation:</b> The Party, whether you or Passdown, who chooses to initiate the proceedings must provide a written notice to the other Party in accordance with the American Arbitration Association rules and forms. The written notice must be addressed to Passdown, Attn: Legal Dep’t, 530 Technology, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92618.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Single Arbitrator:</b> Whenever possible, to conserve costs and increase simplicity, a single arbitrator shall hear claims arising from these Terms of Service, unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise. The Parties shall select the arbitrator from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If they are unable to agree on which arbitrator to appoint, the AAA rules will govern the arbitrator’s selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Venue:</b> Los Angeles, California shall be the venue for any arbitration hearings described in this section. The Commercial Arbitration Rules related to in-person hearings shall apply.

            </ul>

            <li>
              <b>Class Action, Jury and Bench Trial Waiver:</b>  Passdown and you hereby agree that, except as provided below, arbitration shall be the sole form of resolution of any disagreement arising out of these Terms of Service and that no such claim or dispute will be subject to a jury or bench trial in any court or tribunal. Both Parties agree to forfeit the right to a jury trial. Furthermore, Passdown and you expressly waive any rights to join a class action in any capacity, and that unless both Parties expressly agree, the arbitrator cannot consolidate more than one person’s claims in the arbitration proceedings. Passdown and you agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts is excluded and not applicable to this proceeding or case.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Fees:</b> Each Party is responsible for paying all applicable filing fees, administrative expenses, and arbitrator fees as provided by the AAA rules. If your claim for damages is $75,000 or less, and is not ruled as frivolous or based on improper purpose (as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b)) by the Arbitrator, Passdown will pay all such fees.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Award:</b> The award shall be provided under the timeframe rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any award provided must meet the following guidelines:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The award shall not affect other parties. The ruling shall not be conferred to another case or Party.
              </li>
              <li>
                The award must include findings and conclusions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Neither party shall have the right to appeal the award.
              </li>
              <li>
                The award must coincide with these Terms of Service.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Passdown hereby waives the right to recover administrative expenses and attorney fees if it prevails in arbitration.

            <li>
              <b>Exceptions to Arbitration:</b> Passdown and you retain the legal right to seek injunctive or equitable relief to protect intellectual property rights and to initiate legal proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to exercise such right. Additionally, each Party retains the right to initiate legal proceedings in small claims court.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Miscellaneous:</b> This Arbitration Agreement will continue to govern the dispute resolution of the Parties upon termination of the Terms of Service.
